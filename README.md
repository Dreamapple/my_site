microblog
=========

A decently featured microblogging web application written in Python and Flask that I'm developing in my Flask Mega-Tutorial series that begins [here](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).


Running
-------

To run the application in the development web server just execute `run.py` with the Python interpreter from the flask virtual environment.
